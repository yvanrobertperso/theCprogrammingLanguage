A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists
of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.

The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one 
character at a time, of which getchar and putchar are the simplest.

Each time it is called, getchar reads the next input character from a text stream
and returns that as its value. That is, after

c = getchar();

the variable c contains the next character of input, that normally comes from the
keyboard.

The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:

putchar(c);

prints the content of the integer variable c, usually on the screen.

See fileCopy.c program for implementation.

What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course, like
everything else, stored internally just as a bit pattern. The type char is 
specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can 
be used.

The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution is 
that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value 
that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called EOF, for ``
end of file''. We must declare c to be a type big enough to hold any value that 
getchar returns. We can't use char since c must be big enough to hold EOF in 
addition to any possible char. Therefore we use int.

EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>.

Character counting
------------------

See program characterCount.c 

The statement
 ++ nc;
introduces the operator ++, which means increment by one. There is a corresponding
operator -- to decrement by one. The operators can be either prefix (++nc) or
postfix (nc++); these 2 forms have different values in expressions.

The character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int.
long integers are at least 32 bits.

The conversion specification %ld tells printf that the corresponding argument is a
long integer.

See program characterCount2.c

It may be possible to cope with even bigger numbers by using a double (double precision float)

Note that printf uses %f for both float and double. %.0f suppresses the printing of 
the decimal point and the fraction part.

The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and 
increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have 
a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, is there to satisfy that 
requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible.

Line counting
-------------

See program linecount.c

The body of the while now consists of an if, which in turn controls the increment ++nl.
The double sign == is the C notation for "is equal to"., to be distinguished from 
the single = that C uses for assignment.

A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the 
numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a 
character constant, although it is just another way to write a small integer. 
So, for example, 'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its 
value is 65, the internal representation of the character A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Word counting
-------------

See program wordCount.c 

Every time the program encounters the first character of a word, it counts one 
more word. The variable state records whether the program is currently in a word 
or not; initially it is ``not in a word'', which is assigned the value OUT.

The operator || means OR. There is a corresponding operator && for AND; its
precedence is just higher than ||. Expressions with || and && are evaluated from
left to right, and it is guaranteed that the evaluation will stop as soon as the
truth or falsehood is known.
