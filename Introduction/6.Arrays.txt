The declaration

 int ndigit [10];

declares ndigit to be an array of 10 integers. Arrays subscripts always start at zero in C.

This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation 
of the digits. For example, the test

if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')

determines whether the character c is a digit. If it is the numeric value of that
digit is
c - '0'
This works only if '0', '1', ..., '9' have consecutive increasing values. 
Fortunately, this is true for all character sets.

By definition, chars are just small integers, so char variables and constants are 
identical to ints in arithmetic expressions. This is natural and convenient; for 
example c-'0' is an integer expression with a value between 0 and 9 corresponding 
to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array 
ndigit.
