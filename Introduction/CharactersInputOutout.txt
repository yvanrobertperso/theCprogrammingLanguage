A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists
of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.

The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one 
character at a time, of which getchar and putchar are the simplest.

Each time it is called, getchar reads the next input character from a text stream
and returns that as its value. That is, after

c = getchar();

the variable c contains the next character of input, that normally comes from the
keyboard.

The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:

putchar(c);

prints the content of the integer variable c, usually on the screen.

See fileCopy.c program for implementation.

What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course, like
everything else, stored internally just as a bit pattern. The type char is 
specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can 
be used.

The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution is 
that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value 
that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called EOF, for ``
end of file''. We must declare c to be a type big enough to hold any value that 
getchar returns. We can't use char since c must be big enough to hold EOF in 
addition to any possible char. Therefore we use int.

EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>.
