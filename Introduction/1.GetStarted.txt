The program hello.c shows the "hello world" program in C.
The name must end in ".c".
To compile it run: 
    $ gcc hello.c -o hello
This will create a file hello that can be run.

------------------------------------------------------------

A C program, whatever its size, consists of functions and variables. A function 
contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables 
store values used during the computation.

in the hello.c program the function is main(). 

Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but ``main'' is special:
your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The first line of the program:

#include <stdio.h>

tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library.
One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to 
provide a list of values, called arguments, to the function it calls. 
The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list.

The statements of a function are enclosed in braces { }.

A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments.

A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a character string or string constant.

The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the newline character, which when printed advances the output to the left margin on the next line.
