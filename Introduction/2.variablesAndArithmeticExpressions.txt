Check the program fahr.c
The line:
/*print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
is a comment.

In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning 
of the function before any executable statements. A declaration announces the properties
of variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables.

The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. 
If it is true (fahr is less than or equal to upper), the body of the loop 
(the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed.

When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution 
continues at the statement that follows the loop.

Note that in C, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. 
So having 5/9 in the formula (line 14) would have resulted in 0 due to truncation.

 printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);

 causes the values of the 2 integers fahr and celsius to be printed with a tab (\t)
 between them.

printf is not part of the C language; there is no input or output defined in C 
itself. printf is just a useful function from the standard library of functions 
that are normally accessible to C programs. The behaviour of printf is defined in
the ANSI standard, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler
and library that conforms to the standard.

Check the program fahr2.c 
Now fahr and celsius are declared as float. 

Writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they 
have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.

%d              print as decimal integer
%6d             print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide
%f              print as floating point
%6f             print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide
%.2f            print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point
%6.2f           print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point.


Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, 
%c for character, %s for character string and %% for itself.
