Check program FahrWithFor.c

This program produces the same answers but is constructed with FOR.
One major change is the elimination of most of the variables; only fahr remains 
and we have made it an int.
The expression that computes the celsius temperature now appears as the third argument
of printf instead of a separate assignment state.

This last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context where it is 
permissible to use the value of some type, you can use a more complicated 
expression of that type. Since the third argument of printf must be a 
floating-point value to match the %6.1f, any floating-point expression can 
occur here.

The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. 
The for is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and 
increment are single statements and logically related, since it is more compact
than while and it keeps the loop control statements together in one place.
