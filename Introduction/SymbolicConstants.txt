It's bad practice to bury ``magic numbers'' like 300 and 20 in a program; 
they convey little information to someone who might have to read the program 
later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. One way to deal with 
magic numbers is to give them meaningful names. A #define line defines a symbolic
name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters:

#define name replacement list

Thereafter, any occurrence of name (not in quotes and not part of another name) 
will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text. The name has the same 
form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a 
letter. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not 
limited to numbers.

Check fahrSymbolic.c for implementation.

The quantities LOWER, UPPER and STEP are symbolic constants, not variables, 
so they do not appear in declarations. Symbolic constant names are conventionally
written in upper case so they can ber readily distinguished from lower case 
variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a #define line.
